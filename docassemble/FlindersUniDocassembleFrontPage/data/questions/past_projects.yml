  **2019 Semester 1**
  *Digital Age* was taught in 2019 Semester 1 using Netoa Logic's proprietary
  no-code platform.  The decision was made to move to Docassemble in 2019
  Semester 2 to provide a more cost-effective solution to our access-to-justice
  clients and to provide a more flexible Intellectual Property regime.
